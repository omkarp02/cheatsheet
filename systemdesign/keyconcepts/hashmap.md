hash map are bad on disk 
because the value are distrubuted evenly on the hard disk so perfomrance is poor so hash indexes are alwyas keep on memory but ram is expensive. so this is one issue but they are super fast and one downside is ram is not durable which can be prevented by write ahead log

last problem can't do range query
so like get allrow with a to b

so we can easily check if alex is presetn but to check all the name from a to b is intensive
