### **Partitioning in Distributed Databases**
Partitioning is a technique used to **distribute data** across multiple nodes to improve **scalability** and **performance**.

---

## **1. Range-Based Partitioning**
- Data is divided into **contiguous ranges** based on a key.
- Example:
    - **Partition 1** → Keys `A to C` 
    - **Partition 2** → Keys `D to F` 
    - **Partition 3** → Keys `G to I` 
✅ **Pros:**
 ✔ **Great for range queries** (e.g., finding all customers whose names start with "A–C" is efficient).

❌ **Cons:**
 ❌ **Hotspots** – Some partitions get more traffic than others (e.g., if many users have names starting with "A").

---

## **2. Hash-Based Partitioning**
- The partition is determined by applying a **hash function** to the key.
- Example:
    - `hash("Alice") → Partition 2` 
    - `hash("Bob") → Partition 3` 
✅ **Pros:**
 ✔ **Even distribution of keys** – Prevents hotspots.

❌ **Cons:**
 ❌ **No local range queries** – Related keys may end up in different partitions, making range queries inefficient.

---

## **3. Hash-Range Partitioning**
- A combination of **hashing and range partitioning**.
- Steps:
    1. First, apply a **hash function** to distribute data evenly.
    2. Then, use **range partitioning** within each hashed bucket.
✅ **Pros:**
 ✔ **More balanced load** compared to pure range-based partitioning.
 ✔ **Improves performance of range queries within each bucket**.

❌ **Cons:**
 ❌ **More complex partitioning logic**.

## **4. Secondary Indexes in Distributed Databases**
A **secondary index** allows efficient lookups on fields **other than the primary key**.

### **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**
- Each node maintains an index **only for its own partition**.
- Faster queries but limited to the local node.
- Example: Querying a user by email when the primary key is `user_id` .
### **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**
- An index that **spans all partitions**.
- Requires coordination across nodes.
- Used in **DynamoDB, Cassandra**.
- **Slower writes** because the index must be updated globally.
✅ **Pros of GSI:**
 ✔ Enables **fast queries** on non-primary key fields.

❌ **Cons of GSI:**
 ❌ **Increased write latency** (since index updates must be propagated).

| **Partitioning Type** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Range-Based Partitioning** | <p>Great for </p><p>**range queries**</p> | Hotspots due to uneven data distribution |
| **Hash-Based Partitioning** | Even data distribution, prevents hotspots | No efficient range queries |
| **Hash-Range Partitioning** | Balances load, supports local range queries | More complex |
| **Local Secondary Index** | Fast lookups per node | Cannot search across all partitions |
| **Global Secondary Index** | Enables cross-node queries | Higher write latency |
