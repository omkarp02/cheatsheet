Replication

syncronous replication and asyncronous replication

eventual consistency

strong consistency



### **Monotonic Reads**
Monotonic reads ensure that if a user reads a value from a database, they will never see an older version of that value in subsequent reads.

#### **Example:**
- A user writes data to a system with multiple replicas.
- Not all replicas are updated at the same time.
- The user first reads from an updated replica and sees the latest data.
- Later, the user reads from a less updated replica and sees an older version of the data.
This violates **monotonic reads**, as the user expects consistency in the order of updates.

A system with **monotonic reads** guarantees that once a user sees a particular version of data, they will never see an older version in future reads.

Fix: user can read from one replica



### **Consistent Prefix Reads**
Consistent Prefix Reads ensure that if a system applies updates in a certain order, any read operation will always observe the updates in that order—never out of sequence.

#### **Example:**
Imagine a chat application where messages are replicated across multiple servers.

1. **User A** sends two messages in sequence:
    - **Message 1:** "Hello"
    - **Message 2:** "How are you?"
2. Due to replication delays, some servers receive **Message 2** before **Message 1**.
3. **User B** reads from an inconsistent replica and sees:
    - "How are you?" (but **not** "Hello")
This violates **consistent prefix reads** because the user sees messages out of order.

#### **Key Guarantee:**
A system with **consistent prefix reads** ensures that if a user sees a later update, they must have seen all preceding updates. This prevents reading out-of-order data.

Fix: make sure the write are going to same partition





### **Single Leader Replication**
In **single leader replication**, one node (the leader) handles all write operations, while followers replicate the leader's data. This setup provides increased durability and improved read throughput.

#### **Benefits:**
✅ **Increased Durability** – Data is replicated across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data loss.
 ✅ **Higher Read Throughput** – Followers can handle read requests, reducing the load on the leader.



### **Failure Scenarios**
#### **1. Follower Failure**
- If a follower goes down, it can **catch up** with missed updates once it comes back online by syncing from the leader.
- Since the leader is still available, write and read operations continue unaffected.
#### **2. Leader Failure**
- If the leader goes down, the system must **elect a new leader** from the followers.
- This process can introduce challenges:
##### **Issue: Split Brain**
- If two followers **independently** assume leadership, the system may have **two leaders**, leading to:
    - **Data inconsistency** – Different leaders may accept conflicting writes.
    - **Diverging replicas** – Some nodes follow one leader while others follow another.
- If leader goes down and follower is elected as new leader there can be data in consistency because leader was holding some data which was not replicated to follower




### **Multi-Leader Replication**
In **multi-leader replication**, multiple nodes can accept writes, and changes are asynchronously replicated between them. This is useful in geographically distributed systems where users need low-latency writes.

#### **Example Use Case:**
- If a user in **Africa** and a user in **India** need fast write access, having a write node closer to them improves performance.
- Multi-leader replication allows them to write locally while ensuring eventual consistency across all nodes.

## **Topologies in Multi-Leader Replication**
### **1. Circle Topology (Ring Topology)**
Each leader replicates data to one other leader in a **circular chain**.
 🔹 **Pros:**
 ✔ Efficient use of network bandwidth.
 ✔ Reduces replication overhead.
 🔹 **Cons:**
 ❌ If one node fails, it can break the chain.
 ❌ Slower replication if the chain is long.

### **2. Star Topology**
A central leader connects to multiple secondary leaders.
 🔹 **Pros:**
 ✔ Fast replication to all nodes.
 ✔ Easier to manage conflicts centrally.
 🔹 **Cons:**
 ❌ The central leader can become a bottleneck.
 ❌ If the central node fails, replication may stop.

### **3. All-to-All Topology (Mesh Topology)**
Every leader replicates to every other leader.
 🔹 **Pros:**
 ✔ Fastest replication method.
 ✔ High availability and fault tolerance.
 🔹 **Cons:**
 ❌ High network and storage overhead.
 ❌ More chances for **write conflicts** due to concurrent writes.

## **Issues in Multi-Leader Replication**
### **Write Conflicts**
- When two users write to different leaders **at the same time**, conflicts can arise.
- Example:
    - A user in India updates a product price to **$50**.
    - A user in Africa updates the same product to **$45**.
    - Now, different leaders have conflicting values.
---

## **Solutions to Write Conflicts**
### **1. Last Write Wins (LWW)**
- The latest timestamped write is considered the valid update.
- **Problem:** May lose important updates if timestamps are not perfectly synced.
### **2. Version Vectors**
- Each update carries a **version number** that helps detect conflicts.
- The system can track whether an update is newer or if there's a conflict requiring manual resolution.
### **3. Storing Siblings (Conflict Resolution at Read Time)**
- Instead of choosing a winner, the system stores **multiple versions** (siblings) of the data.
- The application or user resolves the conflict manually when reading the data.

### **CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type)**
**CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)** are special data structures designed for distributed systems that allow multiple replicas to **update independently** and **merge changes automatically** without conflicts.

🔹 **Why CRDTs?**

- In **multi-leader replication**, concurrent writes can cause **conflicts**.
- **CRDTs solve this by ensuring data consistency without requiring coordination.**
- They guarantee that **all replicas eventually converge** to the same state, no matter the order of updates.


### **Leaderless Replication**
In **leaderless replication**, there is no single leader managing writes. Instead, clients can write to multiple replicas simultaneously, and the system ensures consistency through **versioning and read-repair mechanisms**.

📌 **Used in**: Cassandra, Riak

## **How Leaderless Replication Works**
1. **Writing Data**
    - The client sends a write request to **multiple replicas**.
    - Each write carries a **version number** (e.g., a timestamp or vector clock).
    - Not all replicas need to receive the write immediately few can
2. **Reading Data (Read Repair)**
    - The client reads from multiple replicas.
    - If different versions are found, the system keeps the **newest version** (Jordan is cute, v2).
    - The system **automatically updates** the stale replica, a process known as **read repair**.
