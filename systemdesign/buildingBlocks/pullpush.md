this means socket i think 

this is not easy to scale because like in youtule when user upload video now it need to tnotify to million of user thourgh socket so push notificatin thorugh socket which is difficult to scale

kafka uses this, long polling is like polling it make request to backend do you have this if backend check and it did'nt have anything it don't return is just do polling in backend and check if it have when the information is ready it ship the information to client at this time client is not waiting as this is asyncounous
