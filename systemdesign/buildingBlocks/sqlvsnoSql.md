nosql is has lower consistnecy but has inbuild fetaure like sharding and quoram

read speed is greater of nosql database beacuse how data is store in relation we need to store data in table an row so to fetch data it can get complex

this is how it can get complex

but in mongodb we can store data according to our needs so that it can be easily accessilble.
there is flexible shcema in nosql like in sql if there is notrequried field we need to store null in it

storage efficency wise maybe rdbms efficent becaue the key is stored on ly once in no sql been a document the key is store in ervery document
