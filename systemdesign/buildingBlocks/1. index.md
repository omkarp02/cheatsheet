B-tree

- Here read is quick
- write is very slow
- since the value is store in node this can be a great disadvantage
- Like in the image given below what if we have to get node 1, 3 and 5 it will take 3 io

B+ tree

- Here read is quick
- write is very slow
- the sequencial scan is fast


LSM tree



write here are very fast

Is any self balance binary tree durability manage by write ahead logs

when lsm tree grows it get converted to ss tables 

sstables is sorted which is immutable

compaction is performed





Advantages of all index



lsm tree

numer of key no limite by memory

fast writes to memory compared to b-trees slow compared to hash index

support range quries ut slow compared to b-tree on reads need to check all sstables

extra cpu usage for compaction



b-tree



fast range uries

number of key not limited y meory

slow writes to tree on disk



hash index

o1 read and write in memory

key need to in meory

no range queryies



clustered index
