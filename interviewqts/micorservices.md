advantage of monolith

easy to develop and testing, deploy, debug
latency is very slow

disadvnatge
get very big so if new developer on board need to explain the whole shit
longer releases one small change need to realse the whole application
difficult to scale if one part getting more traffic need to scale whole app

mircroservice

can scale each service independently
microservice commnuination tcp, grpc, api, message broker

advantage

single responsibiltiy, can deploy a single service wihtout affecting the other servcie
each can take own tech stack 
scalibity is good and continuous deployment

disadantage

microservice hard to debug
