advantage of monolith

easy to develop and testing, deploy, debug
latency is very slow

disadvnatge
get very big so if new developer on board need to explain the whole shit
longer releases one small change need to realse the whole application
difficult to scale if one part getting more traffic need to scale whole app

mircroservice

can scale each service independently
microservice commnuination tcp, grpc, api, message broker

advantage

single responsibiltiy, can deploy a single service wihtout affecting the other servcie
each can take own tech stack 
scalibity is good and continuous deployment

disadantage

microservice hard to debug

so created like automated loan platform so user can upload docuemnt which are like verificed by some external api
then according to the details is the customer is eligible so he appliatino is send to admin were he verify the document manully based on that after this it is move to underwriter after the loan is sanctioned the loan card is generated based on laod amount and tenure of the loan 

. mostly i worked on whole module or entire project so i more complex thing it  would be best making decistion which are suitable for this particurlar requirement mostly on database schema level or strutural level while making library it would be frontend library or 

So i don't recall now since it's like 10month i have not worked on anything complex and i don't  understand what cmplexity level you have in mind,  but if i had to say I like never worked on bug fixing or things like this i always worked on entire project or entire module so i difficulty i faced was make the inital decision like what the schema design, what structure for my project, what library would be best suited for this requirement because we can't mess up here. like current project i have working on tanstack router
