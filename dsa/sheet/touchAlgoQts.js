largest rectnage histogram just see this once or try yourself
Maximal Rectangles

Sliding Window maximum - try this yourself can be done using dequeue

LRU - Cache

/*

you can check the striver 1st video for algorithm

check this question optimal solution
Max Consecutive Ones III


Binary Subarrays With Sum check this for algo 3

/*
    Bianry tree 

    get the number of nodes in complete binary tree where all nodes are present by  (2 power n) - 1

    see all the iterative traversal
    you can check striver level order travelsal it uses while and for loop
    check top view of binary tree

    Maximum Width of Binary Tree  - check this question

     Check for Children Sum Property

     Count total Nodes in a COMPLETE Binary Tree - try this if you want

     Burn the binary tree this can be done by bfs traversal . first mark the parent pointer so you can visit parent left right
