Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Majority Element - Moore Voting algorithm

count inversion - can be done using merge sort

see the algo 1 and algo 2 and algo 3 in  algo folder
see the combination 2 problem algo one time directly wathc the video on this follow up watch quesiton subeset 2

/*
Stack Queue


largest rectnage histogram just see this once or try yourself
Maximal Rectangles

Sliding Window maximum - try this yourself can be done using dequeue

LRU - Cache

*/

/*

you can check the striver 1st video for algorithm

check this question optimal solution
Max Consecutive Ones III


Binary Subarrays With Sum check this for algo 3

*/

/*
    Bianry tree 

    get the number of nodes in complete binary tree where all nodes are present by  (2 power n) - 1

    see all the iterative traversal
    you can check striver level order travelsal it uses while and for loop
    check top view of binary tree

    Maximum Width of Binary Tree  - check this question

     Check for Children Sum Property

     Count total Nodes in a COMPLETE Binary Tree - try this if you want

     Burn the binary tree this can be done by bfs traversal . first mark the parent pointer so you can visit parent left right


*/

/*
    Binary search tree

    Check if a tree is a BST or BT - see this if conceptual or not - check this min max algo it is imp


*/

/*

0/1 Matrix this uses bfs distance algo and it uses multi source bfs also check this once
word ladder 2 check this out

	
Djisktra's Algorithm

	
Bellman Ford Algorithm

Floyd Warshal Algorithm

/*

just seee the dp1 introductino video
1dp was able to solve everything easily

2dp

Minimum/Maximum Falling Path Sum (DP-12)

3-d DP : Ninja and his friends (DP-13)

Subsequence dp

Subset sum equal to target (DP- 14) take overlook of this
Partition Set Into 2 Subsets With Min Absolute Sum Diff (DP- 16)
Minimum Coins (DP - 20) -- this you can do if you want
