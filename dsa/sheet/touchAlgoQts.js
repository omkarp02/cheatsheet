Array

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Majority Element - Moore Voting algorithm

count inversion - can be done using merge sort just check the theory how to do it

three sum

Longest consecutive sequest 
better sort the array
optimal this can be solved using hashmap how figure out yourself

Minimise the maximum difference between heights [V.IMP]


*/

/*


Binary search

Search in Rotated Sorted Array I - keep this algo in mind

peak element algo of kunal kushwaha - just see the also

Find square root of a number in log n - you can just see the algo

Kth Missing Positive Number - see the algo

Recursoin


see the algo 1 and algo 2 and algo 3 algo 4 in  algo folder
see the combination 2 problem algo one time directly wathc the video on this follow up watch quesiton subeset 2



*/

/*
Stack Queue


largest rectnage histogram just see this once or try yourself
Maximal Rectangles

Sliding Window maximum - try this yourself can be done using dequeue

LRU - Cache

*/

/*

you can check the striver 1st video for algorithm

check this question optimal solution
Max Consecutive Ones III


Binary Subarrays With Sum check this for algo 3

/*
    Bianry tree 

    get the number of nodes in complete binary tree where all nodes are present by  (2 power n) - 1

    see all the iterative traversal
    you can check striver level order travelsal it uses while and for loop
    check top view of binary tree

    Maximum Width of Binary Tree  - check this question

     Check for Children Sum Property

     Count total Nodes in a COMPLETE Binary Tree - try this if you want

     Burn the binary tree this can be done by bfs traversal . first mark the parent pointer so you can visit parent left right

/*
    Binary search tree

    Check if a tree is a BST or BT - see this if conceptual or not - check this min max algo it is imp

/*
    here in bfs  mark it as visited as soon as you find it in the adj list and dfs when you start the recurison for that element
    khans algo

    Find Eventual Safe States

    Alien Dictionary




0/1 Matrix this uses bfs distance algo and it uses multi source bfs also check this once
word ladder 2 check this out

just seee the dp1 introductino video
1dp was able to solve everything easily

2dp

Minimum/Maximum Falling Path Sum (DP-12)

3-d DP : Ninja and his friends (DP-13)

Subsequence dp

tabulatino would be first loop of index then target
Subset sum equal to target (DP- 14) take overlook of this
Partition Set Into 2 Subsets With Min Absolute Sum Diff (DP- 16)
Minimum Coins (DP - 20) -- this you can do if you want
