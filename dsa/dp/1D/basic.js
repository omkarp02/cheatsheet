/*

count total number of way apply or min or max apply dp

    here this kind of recursion problem are solved like 

                    1
                2       3    
            4   5       6   7


    what to do 

    first take the base case check the problem house robber for better understanding

    tabulatino

    declare the arr dp
    take the base case dp[0]= 0
    than do a for loop for number of the length of dp array that you find in memoization
    that put the condition used in recursion accordingly
