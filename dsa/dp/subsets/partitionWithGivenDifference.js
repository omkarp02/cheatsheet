//here this is like finding the target only 
/*

questin state find two subset whose difference is target 
so if s1 - s2 should be target according question


s1 + s2 = total
s1 = total - s2

so if s1 - s2 = d
then since s1 is total - s2
total - 2s2 = d
- total + 2s2 = -d
s2 = total - d / 2

so basically the question comes to finding target (total - d) / 2 which is the first question
