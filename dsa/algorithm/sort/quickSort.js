// this you were able to solve just figure out how to put the pivot in correct postion
//take a pivot make all the element smaller than pivot to left and larger to right

/*
    5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    1, 3, 2, 4, 5 => here now all element less than 4 are on the left side and visaversa
    now you can see the pivoted element is on the correction position
