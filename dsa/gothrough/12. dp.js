1D dp 

very easy solved every thing

2d dp

solved every thing

subsequence 

solved every thing

dp on strings

you were able to do yourself
longest common subsequest 

you were able to do yourself
print lcs

you were able to do by your method but check striver method
longest common substring


one string and then reverse second string then do lcs on both
longest palidromic substring

first find the lps and then its intuitive like take the non lcs and reverse put the exact reverse to other side
Minimum insertions to make string palindrome

find the lcs the it's intuitive
Minimum Insertions/Deletions to Convert String | (DP- 30)

this can be solved by lcs dp array you were able to do this yourself
Shortest Common Supersequence


you were able to solve yourself just see the edge case in the problem where you solved in dp section you can find
Distinct Subsequences

just do the theory and figure out the base condition here you messed up earlier
min distance 

easy but you can check striver once
Wildcard Matching 







dp on stocks

able to solve every problem

Buy and Sell Stocks With Cooldown|(DP-39) just check this on for transaction technique


dp on lis

so there are 3 ways to get lis

first normal like recursion and tabulation
2nd stiver non intutive like count one, this get count and print
3rd binary search method this just gets count

check you were not able to do tabulation
Longest Increasing Subsequence |(DP-41)

this you were able to figure out buy your method just like in lcs 
lis print 

sort and do lis just change the condition
Largest Divisible Subset|(DP-44)

using list
Longest String Chain|(DP-45)

	
find lis from start then from end
Longest Bitonic Subsequence 

did'nt get the question
Number of Longest Increasing Subsequences
