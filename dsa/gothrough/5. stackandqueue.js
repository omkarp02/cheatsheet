was  can be done using the monotonic algo
Next Greater Element

this can be donw using nge and pge my solution
and also by adding an hypthetical array
was  can be done using the monotonic algo
Next Greater Element 2

was  can be done using the monotonic algo
Next Smaller Element

Number of NGEs to the right

find left max and right max see the optimal solutions one time
done using prefix max and suffix max this is not nge
Trapping Rainwater

see the individula contribution and apply use nse and pse
Sum of subarray minimum

just find sum of subarray minimum and maximum and subract
Sum of subarray ranges

you can use a stack
Asteroid Collision

monotonic stack algo
Remove k Digits

next smallest and prev smallest
Largest rectangle in a histogram

for  optimzatin get the prefixsum see striver video
Maximal Rectangles

easy dont' solve
Sliding Window maximum

prev greater element
Stock span problem

this one is mermorized
The Celebrity Problem

watch before interview
LRU cache (IMPORTANT)

watch before interview
LFU cache


*************** fucked up question *****************

trapping rainwater optimzed version
Sum of subarray minimum
largest rectange in histogram just once see the optimal solution
