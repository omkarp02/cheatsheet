Alogirthm

make sure this is code

if(a <= b){}else {} make sure you put = every time

  const mid = Math.floor((high + low) / 2);
easy using binary algo
Binary Search to find X in sorted array

easy using binary algo
Implement Lower Bound

easy using binary algo
Implement Upper Bound

easy using binary algo
Search Insert Position

easy using binary algo
Floor/Ceil in Sorted Array

optimal find lower bound and upper bound
easy using binary algo
Find the first or last occurrence of a given number in a sorted array

lower and upper  bound
Count occurrences of a number in a sorted array with duplicates

better: find peak search in first half then in second half
optimal: meorize this algo 
Search in Rotated Sorted Array I

arr[low] = arr[mid] = arr[high] do low++ and high--
Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

pick the sorted half store the minimum from it and elimite whole sorted half
Find minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

find the minimum in array can solve this problem
Find out how many times has an array been rotated

odd even index pattern
Single element in a Sorted Array  

e[mid] > e[mid + 1] decresing part of array , e[mid] < e[mid + 1] increasing part of array
here just write condition for increasing part of array and decreasing part of array
Find peak element


answers pattern
Find square root of a number in log n

same as above	
Find the Nth root of a number using binary search

you are like maintian a minimum distance of x 
Aggresive Cows


here see you need to find min book you can allocate so start from 49 like we can allocate till 49 books then increase
if able to allocate exactly n student condition to break for linear search
Allocate Book

this first try with brute force like finding max diff then placing the gas statin in center of it
optimal try using priorty queue for inner loop
Minimise Maximum Distance between Gas Stations

same as above
Split array - Largest Sum

same as above
Painter's partition

very easy 
brute: normal merge two sorted array using extra space and find median
better: we have two sorted array find the middle index and do with two pointer method
Median of 2 sorted arrays

easy just like above
K-th element of two sorted arrays 

brute you know
better using lower boudn and upper boudn on every array
Find the row with maximum number of 1's

brute
better do binary search on inner array
optimal hypotetically flatten a 2d array to 1d array so start is 0 and end is n * m - 1
here to get row index / m and to get col index % m
Search in a 2 D matrix

optimal: stand on grid[0][col - 1] and start elementing
Search in a row and column wise sorted matrix


Find Peak Element (2D Matrix)

*********** fucked up question **************

peak element
kth missing number
