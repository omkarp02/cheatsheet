Preorder Traversal of Binary Tree

Left, Root, Right.
Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree

Left, Right, Root
Post-order Traversal of Binary Tree

this can be done using queue
Level order Traversal / Level order traversal in spiral form

use stack  then pop root and push roots right and left in order
Iterative Preorder Traversal of Binary Tree

go left if null pop and print and root = root.right
Iterative Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree

take two stack in stack one go like root then roots left and right in order order push in stack
Post-order Traversal of Binary Tree using 2 stack

Post-order Traversal of Binary Tree using 1 stack

Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder Traversal in one Traversal

Math.max(left, right) + 1
Height of a Binary Tree

recursion
Check if the Binary tree is height-balanced or not

recursion
Diameter of Binary Tree

recursion
Maximum path sum

recursion
Check if two trees are identical or not

level order traversal
Zig Zag Traversal of Binary Tree

print the left boundary excluding the leaf node (leaf node which don't have left and right)
print all the leaf node using preorder
same what you did for left boundary just put the element in stack then reverse
Boundary Traversal of Binary Tree

use levelorder and -1 and +1 algo
Vertical Order Traversal of Binary Tree

use levelorder and -1 and +1 algo
Top View of Binary Tree

use levelorder and -1 and +1 algo
Bottom View of Binary Tree

level order
Right/Left View of Binary Tree

recursion
Symmetric Binary Tree

use inorder
Root to Node Path in Binary Tree

you know this
LCA in Binary Tree

this one i did'nt do
Maximum width of a Binary Tree

this one take first node < then child make child that node
Check for Children Sum Property

level order traversal to find parent, then do bfs till the distance k
Print all the Nodes at a distance of K in a Binary Tree

figure out parent using level order traversal then do bfs
Minimum time taken to BURN the Binary Tree from a Node

better: any traversal
optimal: get height of sub tree like just traverse the border and get height if equal then do this formula 2byh - 1 you can see code one time you will understand
Count total Nodes in a COMPLETE Binary Tree

Requirements needed to construct a Unique Binary Tree | Theory

if you are given a inorder and preorder you can only create a unique binary tree
find the root using preorder and then using inorder you now root now inorder tells the left side and right side and repeat
Construct Binary Tree from inorder and preorder

if you are given a inorder and postorder you can only create a unique binary tree
same as above
Construct the Binary Tree from Postorder and Inorder Traversal

Serialize and deserialize Binary Tree

Morris  of a Binary Tree

go to right and perform deed

node null return
go right
go left
node -> right = prev
node -> left = null
prev = root
