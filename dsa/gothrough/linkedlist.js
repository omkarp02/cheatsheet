too easy 
Reverse a LinkedList [Iterative]

too easy
Reverse a LL [Recursive]

fast and slow pointer where they meet
Detect a loop in LL

find length of loop and then move one pointer from start to the length of the loop then keep on pointer on start and move the cur and start pointer one by one till they meet
Find the starting point in LL

fast and slow pointer
Length of Loop in LL

find mid and then reverse and check
Check if LL is palindrome or not

this is easy
Segrregate odd and even nodes in LL

Remove Nth node from the back of the LL

Delete the middle node of LL

Sort LL

Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links

Find the intersection point of Y LL

Add 1 to a number represented by LL

Add 2 numbers in LL
