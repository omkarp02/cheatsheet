Ceil in a Binary Search Tree

easy
Floor in a Binary Search Tree

here like start from root node and start compare till you find a suitable position use while loop
Insert a given Node in Binary Search Tree

this you can do
Delete a Node in Binary Search Tree

in order can be done
Find K-th smallest/largest element in BST

here you need to keep track of low bound and upper bound using min max algo
Check if a tree is a BST or BT

very easy
LCA in Binary Search Tree

better: get inorder from preorder and construct unique binary tree
optimal: using max min algo here just use upper boudn
Construct a BST from a preorder traversal

better: do inorder
optimal: use inorder property and find first maximum
Inorder Successor/Predecessor in BST


binary search iterator

brute: find inorder of both bst => merge both array => the convert inorder to bst
better: convert bst to sorted linkedlist => merge => ll to bst
Merge 2 BST's

better find inorder traversal and store in array, start traversing from start and end
This same from can be solved using the bst iterrot keep two iterator one that iterate from start and one from end and apply the same logic
Two Sum In BST | Check if there exists a pair with Sum K

brute: find inorder run inorder along with bst and check if it is correct if not change the value
find the inorder store in array and again travese the tree and placing the correct inorder
Recover BST | Correct BST with two nodes swapped

brute use validate  bst algo
better : get left largest , get right smallest using the min max algo
Largest BST in Binary Tree
