BFS

easy
DFS

easy use bfs or dfs
Number of provinces (leetcode)

so there are two rotten orange push both in queue and start bfs
Rotten Oranges

bfs
Flood fill

bfs make sure you use parent
Cycle Detection in unirected Graph (bfs)

dfs make sure to use parent
Cycle Detection in undirected Graph (dfs)

put all 1 in queue and do bfs
0/1 Matrix (Bfs Problem)

dfs
Surrounded Regions (dfs)

easy
Number of Enclaves [flood fill implementation - multisource]

bfs algo
put in queue word, level and remove from wordlist once visited
Word ladder - 1

use set
push this in queue [bat] [bat, pot , tot]
Word ladder - 2

easy
Number of Distinct Islands [dfs multisource]

dfs
Bipartite Graph (DFS)

use backtracking
Cycle Detection in Directed Graph (DFS)


do dfs once you reach end put in stack
Topo Sort (dfs)

this only for directed asyclic graph
so basically find the node with indegree 0 and put them in queue and start decreasing the neighboring and pop whose indegree is 0
Kahn's Algorithm (topo sort bfs) 

easy use topo sort
Cycle Detection in Directed Graph (BFS)

using topo bfs sort
Course Schedule - I

using topo bfs sort
Course Schedule - II

can be done using dfs vis and pathvis algo
bfs: reverse all the edges and do topolocical sort
Find eventual safe states

just compare letter of first char of first word and first char of second word and form a graph
and do topo sort of bfs
Alien dictionary

plain bfs algo and dist array
Shortest Path in UG with unit weights

do topo sort => take node out from stack and start marking the distance of there adj node 
Shortest Path in DAG

use min heap + dist arr
Djisktra's Algorithm

Why priority Queue is used in Djisktra's Algorithm

use djisktra
Shortest path in a binary maze

take min heap and in dist array keep the min diff
Path with minimum effort

no need for priority queue just keep the algo around stops
Cheapest flights within k stops

Network Delay time

need to maintain two array one for dist and another for ways
Number of ways to arrive at destination

Minimum steps to reach end from start by performing multiplication and mod operations with array elements

Bellman Ford Algorithm

Floyd Warshal Algorithm

Find the city with the smallest number of neighbors in a threshold distance
