/*


max at top is always complete binary tree
parent i / 2 | left child  2 * i | right 2 * i + 1
it is represented in array from 1

Insert in last index and compare above

in heap only root node is deleted


can be done using min heap
Kth largest element in an array [use priority queue]

max heap
Kth smallest element in an array [use priority queue]


Sort K sorted array

make a custom heap with data {array current index value, index, array number}
Merge M sorted Lists

use min priority queue and store (value and index)
Replace each array element by its corresponding rank

your solutoin hash map
optimal can be done using max heap and queue
see needtcode video
Task Scheduler

use haspmap [value, count] and min heap

optimal => take two small rope and add them then again take two small rope and add them
Connect `n` ropes with minimal cost


Kth largest element in a stream of running integers


Maximum Sum Combination


Find Median from Data Stream

brute = hashmap and max heap
optimal = bucket sort
K most frequent elements
