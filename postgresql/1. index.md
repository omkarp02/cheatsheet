## Create Table
```

CREATE TABLE cities (
  name VARCHAR(50), 
  country VARCHAR(50),
  population INTEGER,
  area INTEGER
);

```

## Insert 

```

INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES 
	('Delhi', 'India', 28125000, 2240),
  ('Shanghai', 'China', 22125000, 4015),
  ('Sao Paulo', 'Brazil', 20935000, 3043);

```

## Select

```

SELECT name || country FROM cities;

SELECT name || ', ' || country FROM cities;

SELECT name || ', ' || country AS location FROM cities;

SELECT CONCAT(name, country) AS location FROM cities;

SELECT CONCAT(name, ', ', country) AS location FROM cities;

SELECT
  CONCAT(UPPER(name), ', ', UPPER(country)) AS location
FROM
  cities;

SELECT
  UPPER(CONCAT(name, ', ', country)) AS location
FROM
  cities;
  
  ```

## Where

```
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE area > 4000;
```


## Update

```

UPDATE courses
SET published_date = '2020-08-01' 
WHERE course_id = 3;

```
## Delete

```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Foreign key

```
CREATE TABLE photos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  url VARCHAR(50)
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES 
)

```

## Cascade

```
CREATE TABLE photos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  url VARCHAR(50)
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)  >>>> here we can set DELETE SET NULL  or here is other one ON DELETE CASCADE
)

delete on cascade means when ther userid is deleted either delete this record or set to null

```



mongodb don't have cascade, subquery, store time by timezone and other time stuff, direct database level validation

database level validation => 
  validation still applied even if connect from different client, 
  can apply new validation rule if existing row satisfy it
