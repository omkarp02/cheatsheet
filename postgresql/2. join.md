## Join

```
SELECT contents, username
FROM comments
JOIN users on users.id = comments.user_id


SELECT contents, username, comments.id, uses.id
FROM comments AS c
JOIN users on users.id = c.user_id



SELECT contents, username, comments.id, uses.id
FROM comments AS c
LEFT JOIN users on users.id = c.user_id


so here even if some comment have user_id null but they will also be considered and the right side will be set to null means field from comments will be considered right visaversa



LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL JOIN


```
## JOIN WITH WHERE

```


SELECT urt, contents
FROM comments
JOIN photos ON photos.id = comments.photo_id
WHERE comments.user_id = photos.user_id ;

```
## Three way join

```

SELECT urt, contents, username
FROM comments
JOIN photos ON photos.id = comments.photo_id
JOIN users ON users.id = comments.user_id AND users.id =  photo.user_id


```
