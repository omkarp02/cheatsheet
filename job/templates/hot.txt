Subject: This Will Only Take 60 Seconds

Hi [Hiring Manager’s Name],

Before you go through my résumé, I’d love it if you read this first — it will give you a better sense of who I am in just 60 seconds.

I’m someone who has always been curious about how things are engineered — from how a CPU works at the lowest level to how large, distributed systems are designed.

I might not have those big product-company names on my résumé, but I’ve spent the last 3 years building products across insurance, fintech, e-commerce, and e-learning — often as the only engineer making it all happen.

That’s exactly why I’m reaching out — I’m looking for an opportunity where I can bring this mindset to a team. While I’m confident in my skills, I understand that my job switches might give an unclear picture of me. I had clear reasons for each one. If you’d like to know more beyond that, I’d be happy to discuss it on a quick call.

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Best,
Omkar Pawar

I’ve always been curious about how things are engineered — from how a CPU works at the lowest level to how large systems are designed. I enjoy reading articles and watching Hussein Nasser’s videos for fun, which keeps me fascinated and drives me to dive deep into the technologies I work on.

I don’t have big product-company names on my résumé, and my job switches might give an unclear picture, but I had clear reasons for each, and I’m confident in the skills I’ve been building over the past 3 years.
