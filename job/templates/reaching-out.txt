Subject: This Will Only Take 60 Seconds

Hi [Hiring Manager’s Name],

Before you go through my résumé, I’d love it if you read this first — it will give you a better sense of who I am in just 60 seconds.

I’m someone who has always been curious about how things are engineered — from how a CPU works at the lowest level to how large, distributed systems are designed.

I might not have those big product-company names on my résumé, but I’ve spent the last 3 years building products across insurance, fintech, e-commerce, and e-learning — often as the only engineer making it all happen.

That’s exactly why I’m reaching out — I’m looking for an opportunity where I can bring this mindset to a team. While I’m confident in my skills, I understand that my job switches might give an unclear picture of me. I had clear reasons for each one. If you’d like to know more beyond that, I’d be happy to discuss it on a quick call.

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Best,

I saw a job opening at your company and wanted to reach out. Before asking for a referral, I’d love it if you could read this first, it’ll give you a quick sense of who I am in just 60 seconds.

I’ve always been curious about how things are engineered — from how a CPU works at the lowest level to how large systems are designed. I enjoy reading articles and watching videos for fun, which keeps me fascinated and drives me to dive deep into the technologies I work on.

I may not have big product-company names on my resume, and my job switches might give an unclear picture, but I had clear reasons for each, and I’m confident in the skills I’ve been building over the past 3 years.

I don’t want this referral to go to waste, so I’d really appreciate it only if you feel confident it will go through.

If you’re okay to refer me, here are my details:
