Example #1: Connecting With A Non-Traditional Background

Hi Jennifer, I hope you're having a great week! I came across your profile looking for people who made the jump into Big Tech Company. Your journey from CPG to UX in Fintech really stood out to me. If you don't mind me asking, what resource was most helpful in that transition?

Example #2: Connecting Based On Someone's Portfolio Or Work

Hi Steve, hope you're having a wonderful week! I was looking for people doing interesting things in the graphic design space and I stumbled across your portfolio. I absolutely loved your case study where you refreshed Slack's interface to be more modern and user friendly. Do you mind if I share it in a post?

Example #3: Connecting With Someone Who Regularly Posts Content

Hey Taylor, hope you're doing well! I've been loving your content, especially your recent post on Challenger selling. I grabbed a copy of the book at your recommendation, excited to dive in. Just wanted to connect so I could stay up to date with your posts!

Example #4: Connecting Via A Mutually Beneficial Introduction

Hey Jamal, hope you're having a fantastic summer! I loved your interview at the Summit Series. You mentioned that you're hosting a live event in October, I'd love to help you drive some more ticket sales. A friend of mine hosts a podcast focused on Spirituality In Your Career and I think his audience would love your stuff. Let me know if you'd like an intro.
