Describe what makes you a right fit for this role


I love everything about what COMPANY is doing. I don't have many hobbies outside coding. I am not athletic, bad at singing, don't drink, can't dance. Building is the only thing I am good at. At this point, I want to be a part of taking something from 0-> 1 or 1-> 100. I just want to be heads down chasing that goal

Over the past 3 years, I’ve built around 6 projects from the ground up — taking complete ownership from understanding requirements to design, development, and deployment.

Now, I’m looking for a team where I can go all-in, solve real problems, and grow alongside ambitious builders who care deeply about what they’re creating.

Hi,
Really loved what you were building at Happenstance and wanted to reach out to see if there were any openings for
Engineers in the early team. I have 5 years of relevant experience building full-stack applications primarily data-driven
at DynamoAl (https://dynamo.ai), Antimetal (https://antimetal.com) Union.ai (https://union.ai), Synthesia
(https://synthesia.io)and Alan (https://alan.app)as a part of their early teams where I helped scale internal micro-
services to thousands of workflows and users
Being a part of super lean teams, one of my strongest suites has been ability to work across the stack from building
scalable, robust backend systems to high throughput data ingestion pipelines to production grade frontend
components in React. As a part, I have build several end-to-end systems that involve several layers at the intersection of Ul (Next.js), Backend (Python, Node + Go based services using GraphQL and GRPC) as well as infrastructure pieces(AWS + GCP over K8s) from building complex workflows, DAG visualizations and drag and drop component canvas for Union cloud to architecting the entire platform for Alan Studio and Synthesia.
I would love to be a part of the early team at Happenstance and define its work and culture. Looking forward to hearing
from you soon!
Best,
Soham
