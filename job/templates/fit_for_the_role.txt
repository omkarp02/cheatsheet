I’m someone who’s happiest when I’m building—whether that’s designing scalable backend systems in Java Spring Boot, Node.js, or Golang, architecting infrastructure on AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda), or piecing together seamless frontend experiences in React.js and Next.js. I’ve led teams, broken down monoliths into microservices, automated infra with Docker, Kubernetes, and shipped full-fledged platforms from scratch.

What excites me about Big Rattle Technologies is the chance to go deep—help define core systems, ship fast, and work across the stack in an environment that values ownership and real engineering. I’ve built learning platforms, lending systems, and high-performance UIs and more. But what I care most about is working with a team where the focus is clear: build, improve, ship.

Big Rattle feels like the kind of place where that mindset fits—and I’d love to contribute to the kind of work you’re doing.

Ilove every/thing about what Happenstance is doing. I don't have many hobbies outside coding. I am not athletic, bad at singing, don't drink, can't dance. Building is the only thing I am good at. At this point, I want to be a part of taking something from 0-> 1 or 1-> 100. I just want to be heads down chasing that goal
Hi,
Really loved what you were building at Happenstance and wanted to reach out to see if there were any openings for
Engineers in the early team. I have 5 years of relevant experience building full-stack applications primarily data-driven
at DynamoAl (https://dynamo.ai), Antimetal (https://antimetal.com) Union.ai (https://union.ai), Synthesia
(https://synthesia.io)and Alan (https://alan.app)as a part of their early teams where I helped scale internal micro-
services to thousands of workflows and users
Being a part of super lean teams, one of my strongest suites has been ability to work across the stack from building
scalable, robust backend systems to high throughput data ingestion pipelines to production grade frontend
components in React. As a part, I have build several end-to-end systems that involve several layers at the intersection of Ul (Next.js), Backend (Python, Node + Go based services using GraphQL and GRPC) as well as infrastructure pieces(AWS + GCP over K8s) from building complex workflows, DAG visualizations and drag and drop component canvas for Union cloud to architecting the entire platform for Alan Studio and Synthesia.
I would love to be a part of the early team at Happenstance and define its work and culture. Looking forward to hearing
from you soon!
Best,
Soham
