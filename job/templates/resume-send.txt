Hi, before proceeding with the referral, I’d appreciate it if you could review my resume. If you feel it’s not a strong fit, I completely understand — I’d prefer not to use your referral unnecessarily.

Thank you so much for being willing to refer me, I truly appreciate your support.
I’ve already connected with someone else who’s proceeding with the referral for me at the moment. If for any reason that doesn’t go through, I hope it’s okay if I reach out again.
Really grateful for your time and kindness!

again really thanks for the reply

If you're still open to it, I’d be incredibly grateful if you could refer me.
