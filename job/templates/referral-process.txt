Thank you so much for being willing to refer me, I truly appreciate your support.
I’ve already connected with someone else who’s proceeding with the referral for me at the moment. If for any reason that doesn’t go through, I hope it’s okay if I reach out again.
Really grateful for your time and kindness!

again really thanks for your time.

Thanks for this! Before giving the referral, I’d love it if you read this first — it’ll give you a quick sense of who I am in just 60 seconds.

I’ve always been curious about how things are engineered — from how a CPU works at the lowest level to how large systems are designed. I enjoy reading articles and watching Hussein Nasser’s videos for fun, which keeps me fascinated and drives me to dive deep into the technologies I work on.

I don’t have big product-company names on my résumé, and my job switches might give an unclear picture, but I had clear reasons for each, and I’m confident in the skills I’ve been building over the past 3 years.

I don’t want this referral to go to waste, so I’d appreciate it only if you feel confident it will go through.

Thanks a lot for considering!
