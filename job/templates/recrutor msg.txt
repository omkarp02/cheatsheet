---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I viewed the job description for [Job Title] at [Company Name], and it really resonated with me—it matches my background and the kind of work I love doing. Over the last 3 years, I’ve been part of early engineering teams at startups like CodeB and Iorta, working across the stack with Java, Go, and MERN while also deploying scalable infrastructure.

I’ve built and shipped end-to-end features such as form builders, real-time chat applications, video learning platforms, and fintech/insurance solutions. Writing code is what I’m best at, and what excites me most is solving real user pain points, collaborating in small teams, and growing quickly with the product.

I’d love to connect and explore if my background could be a fit for your team at [Company Name].

Best regards,
Omkar Pawar
