Hi, I’m a full stack dev with 3+ yrs of exp 👨‍💻, been putting in 8+ hrs a day for the past year to move into a product role — 500+ DSA Qs, system design, Striver A2Z. I’ve been giving it my all. A referral from you could mean a lot. I’ll share everything needed — just need a shot to prove myself 

I saw a job opening at your company and would really appreciate a referral. I'm a full-stack dev with 3+ yrs of experience, prepping hard (500+ DSA Qs, system design, Striver A2Z). Happy to share my resume—thanks a ton in advance!

I wanted to share a quick update. I had earlier mentioned that someone else was proceeding with my referral — however, I haven’t heard back from them.

If you're still open to it, I’d be incredibly grateful if you could refer me
