Dear Recruiter,
Most of my peers treat job applications like a 
numbers game—polish the resume, click apply, 
and move on. That’s never been me. I’m looking 
for a place where I can bring not just my 
engineering skills, but my ambition to build things 
that matter—things that scale. I’m excited by 
companies that are solving real problems with 
thoughtful systems, and I want to be part of a team 
where that kind of thinking is encouraged from 
the ground up.
In my current and past roles, I often found myself 
thinking beyond the ticket—challenging whether 
the architecture we were building today would 
hold up when the product scaled 10x. I’ve pitched 
design approaches that optimize for long-term 
maintainability and performance. Often, I was told 
we didn’t yet have the user base to “worry about 
all that.” While I understand tradeoffs, I’m eager to 
work in an environment where thinking at scale 
isn’t seen as overengineering—but as foresight. I 
want to contribute in ways that go beyond closing 
tickets—to be part of product and system 
decisions that shape the future of the platform.
Thank you for considering my application. I’d love 
the opportunity to talk about how I can contribute 
to your team—not just with code, but with the 
kind of product-first, systems-aware mindset that 
builds lasting software.
Sincerely,
Omkar Pawar
