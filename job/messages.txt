Example #1: Connecting With A Non-Traditional Background

Hi Jennifer, I hope you're having a great week! I came across your profile looking for people who made the jump into UX from a non-traditional background. Your journey from CPG to UX in Fintech really stood out to me. If you don't mind me asking, what resource was most helpful in that transition?

Example #2: Connecting Based On Someone's Portfolio Or Work

Hi Steve, hope you're having a wonderful week! I was looking for people doing interesting things in the graphic design space and I stumbled across your portfolio. I absolutely loved your case study where you refreshed Slack's interface to be more modern and user friendly. Do you mind if I share it in a post?

Example #3: Connecting With Someone Who Regularly Posts Content

Hey Taylor, hope you're doing well! I've been loving your content, especially your recent post on Challenger selling. I grabbed a copy of the book at your recommendation, excited to dive in. Just wanted to connect so I could stay up to date with your posts!

Example #4: Connecting Via A Mutually Beneficial Introduction

Hey Jamal, hope you're having a fantastic summer! I loved your interview at the Summit Series. You mentioned that you're hosting a live event in October, I'd love to help you drive some more ticket sales. A friend of mine hosts a podcast focused on Spirituality In Your Career and I think his audience would love your stuff. Let me know if you'd like an intro.
