decomposition: business capability, subdomain, transactions, strangler, 
integration: api gateway, aggregator pattern, proxy pattern, gateway routing pattern, chained micrservices,branch pattern 
database: database as service, shared database, cqrs, event sourcing, saga
observability: log aggregation, performance metrics, distributed tracing, health check,
                cross cutting patterns: external configuration, service discovery pattern, circiut breaker pattern, blue-green deployment pattern


most commonly use pattern

aggregation, agi gateway, chained, shared database, event sourcing, cqrs, decomposition, serverless



Decomposition 

To divide big code into small to decide how much small to make
There are diff option to consider -> 

Business capability
Sub domain  -> one sub-domain can have mulitple sub services

decomposition pattern

strangler -> refactoring monolithic to microservice



Database

1. database for each individual service 
    issue => query join, transaction acid



2. one databse for all service (shared database)
    issue -> scaling database by service load
    advantage -> query join, transaction, acid


SAGA pattern  -> this solves transaction issue
no service can query other service database directly they can communicate by calling another service api
this have two way choregraphy and orchastrator

choregraphy is based on event
orchastrotor is based like there is a brain whcih handle all this situation


CQRS 

there will be a common read database
