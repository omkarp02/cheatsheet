monolithic challanges

appliction is too large and compolex
parts are more tangled into each other
you can only scale the entire app, instaed of a specific service
difficulty if service need different dependency versions
release process takes longer because changes taken place need to build test whole application

Microservices

communition between micrservices

by http request (syn communication)
by queue (async communication)
by service mesh


advantage of microservice

use differnent language

downside

configure the communication between service 
error finding monitoring


microservice can be deployed on monorepo and polorepo

on git repo for all service is monorepo and visaversa is polorepo
